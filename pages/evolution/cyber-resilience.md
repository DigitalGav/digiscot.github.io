**Is your organisation talking about cyber resilience?  Do you know what it is and what it means for you?** 

>*‘Being “cyber resilient” is both the prevention of cyber breaches and also making sure that if a breach occurs that you are able to respond without losing business continuity. A cyber breach is an incident in which data is lost or stolen. This could be financial data, security data or personal data – such as contact details.’*

> Kyle Usher, Digital Change Manager, SCVO

With 40% of charities rating their skills in cyber security as ‘low’ or ‘very low’ we’re aware that third sector organisations often lack the knowledge to assess and discuss cyber threats properly.  Additionally, for many Scottish charities cyber resilience is not discussed at a senior level or featured on organisational risk registers. 

We are working with Scottish charities to achieve the following aims: 

1. To build commitment from third sector leaders to assess and improve their cyber resilience.  
2. To test the ability of third sector organisations to achieve [Cyber Essentials accreditation](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/cyberessentials/) through a small scale ‘grants’ programme of up to £1500 to help cover the application and IT support costs needed to achieve accreditation. 

**SCVO Cyber Essential Grants will open at 9am on 21st September 2017. Please check back to this page after that time to complete the application.**

To speak to the team about the SCVO Cyber Essential Grants, please email [onedigital@scvo.org.uk](mailto: onedigital@scvo.org.uk) in the first instance. 

**SCVO Cyber Essential Grants qualifying criteria:**

SCVO Cyber Essentials Grants are available to registered Scottish charities with either their own internal IT support staff or with a contracted IT supplier. 

The maximum annual income threshold to receive our Cyber Essentials Grants is £4 million. 

It is the responsibility of the qualifying organisation to contact and contract a supplier to carry out the accreditation. 

If you do not fit within these criteria but are still interested in becoming more cyber resilient, please contact us at [onedigital@scvo.org.uk](mailto: onedigital@scvo.org.uk)
