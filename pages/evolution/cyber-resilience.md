Is your organisation talking about cyber resilience?  Do you know what it is and what it means for you? 

>‘Being “cyber resilient” is both the prevention of cyber breaches and also making sure that if a breach occurs that you are able to respond without losing business continuity. A cyber breach is an incident in which data is lost or stolen. This could be financial data, security data or personal data – such as contact details.’
> - Kyle Usher, Digital Change Manager, SCVO
