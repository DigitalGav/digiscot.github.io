We at SCVO Digital Team like to digitally inspire and be inspired! So what better way to do that than to find out what’s going on digitally in the third sector and to share it with you! 

Let’s hear from Grampian Housing Association Chief Executive, Neil Clapperton on how he and the organisation are internally embracing the latest in digital to the benefit of their staff, housing and tenants.

### Tell us about Grampian Housing Association!

Grampian Housing Association is a leading housing association based in the North East of Scotland. We have 3500 tenants and shared owners. Beyond being a landlord we also provide other services of advice and support.

### Tell us about a recent digital change you have made

Technically Grampian HA have been using IT for around 30 years but these systems have been very clunky! We have only truly thought about digital in the true sense for the last two years.

More recently we have brought in a new CRM (QL) which is a housing management system centred around customer handling and have looked at automating processes. QL has a number of modules which are connected and handle different aspects of our work e.g. invoices and contact with contractors. We have also introduced back office systems like the Citrix platform which enables employees to work remotely – this is being rolled out as we speak. For remote working we plan to invest in tablets which will allow for real-time assistance to tenants from anywhere, having a knock-on effect with savings e.g. less travel. It is however an ongoing process for both back office and for frontline services.

### What motivated you?

One significant trigger for me was when I talked to the CEO of East Lothian Housing Association, who have themselves been exploring the potential for digital in their organisation. All this spurred me to think about running a truly 21st century service with a model of management to empower staff, ultimately saving money and allowing us to reallocate resources where they're most needed.

### How did you go about it?

First we made a big investment on IT and then developed a digital strategy, which looking back now, really happened the wrong way around. Now it's all very much ongoing and what we need to achieve is staff buy-in. For this reason we're constantly in conversation with our teams to ensure they know that this is a process of change which will improve the service, their day-to-day and give more flexibility to their roles. We've also had an away-day where we shared our vision with the organisation and what it would do for them.

Developing and implementing our vision has been ongoing from the beginning of 2016 and could take around 5 years.

### Who was involved?

I was the key driver behind this change but actually, you could say everyone in our organisation! We also recruited a Director of Operations, Angela who was key for effecting this change. Then you have all of our managers in finance, HR and property services but in reality by the end of it, everyone was.

### What’s been the impact?

The benefits from the changes we’ve implemented won't fully be felt for a couple of years and are incremental. These will be seen, experienced and felt team by team as we work at each particular one. 70% of our staff are in frontline operations and won't benefit just yet but the back office teams are already there. 

Additionally it will free up staff time, resources and change some job roles – not involving redundancy but just switching responsibilities around and making the most of valuable staff time. It's all a bit like a Rubik's cube but the most important thing is maintaining trust. Ultimately it will impact everyone in the organisation and it's an ambitious agenda.

### Any challenges?

Yes. I learnt how important communication is between you and your staff, which can be challenging but well worth it. While implementing change we need to encourage our staff and prevent them from feeling defeated; to understand and acknowledge the difficulties they’d encounter but equally highlight the end gain.

### Any advice?

The thing I learnt from <a target='_blank' href="http://digital.scvo.org.uk/evolution/senior-leader-programme/">One Digital Senior Leadership programme</a> is that it's about the people and not the kit. It's about buy-in and digital inclusion – which as a housing association we see a lot of. But digital exclusion isn't a barrier, it's more a challenge.

I would advise others to get their vision right from the start. Look at your customer first and engage with your staff before buying kit. They have to love your vision in order to get through the rough times. I wish we had approached managers to look at their processes long in advance. Two years ago I wish I had read and learnt what I have today.

### What’s on your digital horizon?

My broader vision is to:

1. maximise interactions online. Get rid of phone / face-to-face interactions where unnecessary with 80%+ done online.

2. devolve and empower local teams so that they are mobile and reduce our footprint. Some workers do move around so by giving them the right tools, we could remodel our structure and reduce rates on office space.

### What’s digitally inspiring you at the moment?

As mentioned earlier, East Lothian Housing Association and then you have other people with online services e.g. online banking. This is an example of a service that's genuinely makde life easier and allows you to do things when you need to, 24/7. 

Also, following the Buurtzorg model of health and social care is one local provider, Cornerstone. What they’ve done is to create a flat, semi-autonomous team structure. I would love to do this and what's more, it opens up the possibility of increasing wages and allowing people to retrain and develop. As an organisation we are 40 years old and as result very hierarchical. This was before the real age of computers so I expect much positive change to come.
