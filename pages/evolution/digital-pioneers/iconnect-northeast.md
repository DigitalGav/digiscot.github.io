We at SCVO Digital Team like to digitally inspire and be inspired! So what better way to do that than to find out what’s going on digitally in the third sector and to share it with you!

Let’s hear from the iConnect North East Team about how they’re using digital to achieve their goals, in particular using Facebook Campaigns to promote Self-Directed Support opportunities and measuring their impact with Google Analytics.

### Tell us about iConnect North East!

iConnect North East is an organisation working across the Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire area to offer advice on Self-Directed Support to a wide range of people. We help to link up the community to events and activities to ensure people have opportunities to be included and are able to contribute. We also offer digital skills support to older learners and those looking for employment through our Digital Champion based project work.

### How have you been using digital?

We’ve always used digital as an organisation; it plays an important role for us to get the day to day work done. From using Office 365 to manage our documents and emails, social media to engage with our community and peers to our website which offers lots of Self-Directed Support information. The internet in general is a very useful tool to empower those we support to find the answers their looking for whilst improving their digital skills.

### Tell us about a recent digital change you’ve made.

The most recent digital opportunity we’ve taken up has been the use of Facebook Campaigns to promote Self-Directed Support opportunities on our website and using Google Analytics to help measure the impact of website traffic.

We’ve run several to date which have all been successful. One of our recent campaigns was in relation to our <a target='_blank' href="https://digitalparticipation.scot/">Digital Participation Charter</a> funded Project ‘Benefits related online Employment support’ which is looking to remove barriers for those unemployed who may have no or limited IT Skills. Our Facebook Campaign promoted the project and advertised frop-in sessions in locations around Aberdeen.

Over the 10 day campaign we had up to 100 people click on the ad which generated a spike in our website traffic to the <a target='_blank' href="https://www.iconnectne.org.uk/how-we-can-help/life-in-the-community/help-with-training-and-employment/">‘Help with Employment and Training’</a> section. They also doubled the time they spent on the website from over 3 minutes to over 6 minutes. We also have over 30 new people come into our office asking for help with employment related digital skills.

A 10 day Facebook Campaign currently costs £100. With this small investment we were able to maximise our marketing budget to reach thousands of new people. It would certainly cost significantly more to have the same impact if we just used traditional communication methods like print marketing or running events.

### What motivated you?

We wanted to reach more people across our community to take advantage of Self-Directed Support opportunities. We were aware as existing Facebook users that the social media platform has the potential to reach and engage a lot of people in a targeted way. From having a website at the core of the Self-Directed Support we offer we were also aware of the need to measure impact and Google Analytics has allowed us to do that. With the potential to raise awareness with clear measurable impact on more people using our website and foot fall through the door asking for support it’s clearly working!

### How did you go about it?

As a Team we agree the parameters of our Campaign such as what’s our message and what do we want people to do, what demographic are we trying to reach, what areas in the region should we focus on and how will we know we’ve had an impact. Once agreed, Facebook Campaigns allows us to target our messages to the right people.

For example, we also ran a recent Facebook Campaign to recruit Personal Care Assistants. We were able to target working aged people within a 10 mile radius of Aberdeen. We had over 2000 new visitors to our website and over 40 people applied for the positions. Over 50% of applicants were taken on are now making a real difference to people’s lives in the local community.

### Who was involved?

As with all our work at iConnect North East it’s a Team effort. With a mix of marketing experience and social media and website know how we’ve found an effective way to raise our profile and the Self-Directed Support opportunities out there.

### What’s been the impact?

For us, we’ve seen a spike in website traffic and people coming through our doors seeking opportunities to get involved or to find support.

For our community it’s meant more involvement and empowerment; people have been able to find solutions, support and ways they can play a role in helping others.

We view our ability to raise the profile of Self-Directed Support as potentially lifesaving. We’ve had people coming through our door ready to give up and feeling suicidal and our intervention has helped change their mind-set.

### Any challenges?

We’ve learnt a lot along the way and have always applied our learning to the next campaign. For example, we found that words on our campaign cover image were blurred out and no longer legible so we were careful in future campaigns to select the right image that conveyed the opportunity rather than relying on words. It’s these little things you come across as you have a go that allow you to improve each time.

### Any advice?

We’d encourage others to dip their toe in and have a go and take the lessons learnt and apply them going forward; it’s an evolving process. The main thing is to make a plan of what it is you want to achieve and get the right people in the team to input.

### What’s on your digital horizon?

More Facebook Campaigns and using data from Google Analytics to inform any improvements to our website to assist with Self-Directed Support.

### What’s digitally inspiring you at the moment?

We’re really interested in assistive technology such as devices with voice control and text to speak reading programmes like Text Help. These are really relevant to our service users and have the ability to transform the way they interact with the wider community.
