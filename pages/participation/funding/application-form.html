                    Supported by the Scottish Government, the next round of the Digital Participation Fund is now open for applications.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Building on an understanding of 'what works' in the development of basic digital skills, the fifth round of the Digital Participation Fund will be focused on two specific themes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Supporting working age people to increase financial capability, employment and other economic outcomes</li>
                    <li>Supporting older people to reduce social isolation and loneliness</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Priority will be given to projects which can demonstrate a track record of working with individuals who are facing issues such as poverty, social isolation and other forms of inequality. We are also particularly looking for applications which focus on inclusive digital skills activity for service users and have evidenced a clear plan for the promotion and development of these skills in the organisation’s own day-to-day activity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If this sounds like you we would be delighted to hear your proposals! <strong>Please complete this application form by 5pm on Thursday 31st August 2017</strong>. If you have any queries about your application please email <a href="mailto:digital@scvo.org.uk">digital@scvo.org.uk</a>
