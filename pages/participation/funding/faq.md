## FAQ and guidance notes

### 1. When is the deadline?

We will stop accepting application forms at 5pm on 31st August. We will not be able to accept applications after this deadline - please leave plenty of time to fill in the form and ensure you are signed up to the [Digital Participation Charter](https://digitalparticipation.scot/sign-up) as we'd hate you to miss out.

### 2. Digital Participation Charter

We're inviting organisations across Scotland to join a national movement to promote digital participation and basic digital skills. By undertaking work as part of the [Charter Fund](/participation/charter-fund/) you will be expected to sign the Charter before submitting your application. If you have not done this you will be unable to proceed with your application. [Read more on the Charter](https://digitalparticipation.scot/the-charter).

### 3. Can I download a blank application form?

We haven't provided a blank application form. However, below is a list of all the questions you'll be asked along with a brief explanatory note.

If you feel supporting information is required to further evidence your project idea this can be emailed separately, with your Organisation and Project Name as the reference, to <a href="mailto:digital@scvo.org.uk">digital@scvo.org.uk</a> following the submission of your application. However, the application will be assessed primarily on the application form. You should make sure that every piece of information you would like considered as part of your application is within the form.

In the next set of questions we'd like you to tell us more about your specific project idea.

There is a word count indicator under each question for guidance.

2. **Start and End Date** - The earliest start date your project can start is 16th October 2017. In the past we have had projects ranging from 6 months to 15 months but the average delivery period has been 9/12 months.
3. **Project Detail** - We'd like to get a clear understanding of your project. Please explain your proposal and how it will support people who don't have basic digital skills. Think about things such as (but not limited to); who are you supporting, who will be running the project, what type of activities you will be doing to support people's learning and what devices will be used (if any) (N.B.

7. **Embedding the activity** - Our evidence tells us that greater success is achieved if passing on basic digital skills is embedded within a regular activity. Please use this space to tell us how you will embed this digital skills activity in to your work? (N.B. There is a 400 word limit for this answer)
8. **Number of people supported** - How many people will be supported to gain basic digital skills?

**Funding & Expenditure**

In this section we'd like you to tell us about the money. How much your project costs in total and some more detail about the main areas of expenditure.

{:.browser-default}
1. **Total amount of funding you are applying for** - please note, the maximum that can be applied for is £10,000. Any projects seeking a larger investment must contact SCVO Digital Team in advance of applying to discuss further.
2. **Main Items of Expenditure:** Please list up to six principle items of expenditure (a minimum of one must be given) - we will need to see a description of the item and the budgeted cost. Please check your figures carefully!

**Project Milestones**

These Milestones should form your project plan

{:.browser-default}
* **Project Plan** - we would like you to outline the key milestones of the project. You are allowed to add up to **4 milestones**.
* **Milestone** - Briefly explain what the key achievement will be
* **Date** - When will you aim to achieve this objective by?

**Declaration**

This must be completed by someone within your organisation who has the authority to make sure that the project will go ahead if successful.

### 4. Can I save my application?

No, we have used this facility in the past but have found that it is easier for us and applicants to employ a one take approach. The above list outlined in point 2 will give you the exact ordering of questions and level of detail you need to construct answers in advance and copy & paste in.

### 5. Can I move backwards and forwards within the application form?

Yes, however, in order to move forwards you do need to add in a small amount of holding text. This text is draft until you press the final submit button and can be edited as often as you like.

### 6. Who is eligible to apply?

The Charter Fund is open to groups and organisations from all sectors. We are particularly interested in supporting groups that work closely with their local community. Applicants must operate in Scotland, with awarded funds being spent entirely in Scotland.

### 7. Can I submit an application in partnership with another organisation?

Of course. We love seeing organisations working together so please feel free to submit a partnership application. The only thing we ask is that one of the organisations is specified as the lead for the duration of the project; they will be the contract holder and take responsibility for the award.

### 8. Can we submit more than one application?

Yes, we will accept more than one application form where several discrete support activities are being proposed and they are not dependent on one another.

### 9. How much can I apply for through the fund?

The minimum amount of funding is £500 and the maximum is £10,000 per project. If you would like to request amounts outside of these parameters please email <A href="mailto:digital@scvo.org.uk">digital@scvo.org.uk</a> for a discussion in the first instance.

### 10. Can we submit an application if we have already had a project funded under the Digital Participation Challenge?

Yes, however, the activity which you are now asking to be funded must not be continuation funding of that previous project.

### 11. How will my application be assessed?

After the deadline has passed, all applications will be allocated to a member of the assessing group made up of members of the SCVO team; a random group of applications will be selected for peer review. We will then hold a meeting where all of the projects / applications deemed suitable will be discussed and a final set of recommended projects will be agreed upon. The team's recommendations are then considered by a panel of experts which has the final approval. We aim to announce our final decisions by the end of September 2017.
