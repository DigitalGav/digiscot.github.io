Our Digital Participation Challenge Fund, supported by by the [Scottish Government](http://www.gov.scot), the ERDF and [BT](http://charter.scvo.org.uk/Signatory/bt-scotland/), invests in community digital participation projects across Scotland. The [projects that we're supporting](/participation/projects/) will enable groups and organisations to digitise content, build digital networks and improve the digital skills of their members, so that they can continue to thrive in the digital world.

## Project criteria
Projects must meet some broad criteria to be considered for funding.

* The project must be about developing the [basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/) of am organisation's staff or the people they're supporting
* The following six focus groups will receive a greater weighting at the assessment stage (please note that we are unlikely to fund projects that are aimed at children):
  * Older people
  * Disabled people
  * Ethnic minority groups
  * Remote and rural communities
  * People seeking benefits
  * Glasgow
* Awards will typically range from £100 to £10,000; applications for more than this will only be considered in exceptional circumstances
* To help us understand what the project has achieved and what lessons others can learn, sucessful projects will be required to:
  * Ask the individuals they're supporting to fill out a short questionnaire to gauge their [basic digital skills](/participation/basic-digital-skills/)
  * Provide regular progress updates by posting content to your project page (here's [an example](/projects/comas/))

Other terms and conditions will also apply. You can download a [pro forma contract](/files/Challenge Fund Contract.pdf) to check you will be able to comply.

We are also working closely with organisations that have signed [Scotland's Digital Participation Charter](http://charter.scvo.org.uk/) to identify additional in-kind support (e.g. donations of equipment and volunteers). You will be able to express your interest in this kind of support by ticking the box at the end of the application form.
