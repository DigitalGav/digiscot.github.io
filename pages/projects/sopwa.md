### Project description

Tea and Technology workshops were successfully delivered at The Lewis Retirement Centre, Bayhead, Stornoway. The twelve week, Wednesday afternoon Drop-in sessions, ran from January to March 2016. With Fifty Eight people registering for the workshops. 

Individuals attending, brought their own equipment and were supported to learn as per their individual needs. This enabled new online social networks and to establish daily links with family and friends in other parts of the world. 

Individuals attending Tea and Technology developed new interests and an awareness of local facilities on Facebook, book marked local news sources and made new friends in the very sociable environment created at the workshops. 

The Centre being wheelchair accessible enabled several people with mobility issues to attend. The Drop-in sessions were run by the Stornoway Old Peoples Welfare Association, with support from Cabraich Community Arts www.cabraich.org. 

This was an innovative project because all other courses locally want to teach IT, not how to use an individual’s mobile phone, kindle, ipad or laptop. Tea and Technology enabled individuals to master their device to fulfil their own new technology ambitions.


### Planned project milestones

* Start of the Drop-in Tea & Technology sessions. Please note that the number of people supported may be much higher as the Drop-in develops but this cannot be forecast accurately: December 2015

* Instructing on Christmas gifts of technology: January 2016

* Project completion and evaluation: February 2016


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* To help the over 60s to feel comfortable with their technology and to reduce or even eliminate the fear that is engendered when faced with ’new’ systems

* To help the over 60s to keep in touch with friends and family by using modern technology

* To make the learning a social occasion where the clients can mix with their peers in a warm and comfortable environment

* Providing reassurance to younger relatives that their seniors know how to use technology to summon help when needed


### Evaluation
*	Week 1 review: Get more volunteer tutors due to high numbers coming through the door.
*	Week 2 review Get even more tutors.as participants numbered 20+ for the first 8 weeks. 
*	Week 12 Project completion and evaluation: April 2016

* Tea and Technology helped the over 60s feel comfortable with their technology and reduced the fear that is engendered when faced with ’new’ systems
* Tea and Technology helped the over 60s coming along, to keep in touch with friends and family by using modern technology
* Tea and Technology was intergenerational as we got the support of the local school and college. This created a social occasion with learning for both generations.
*	Tea and Technology enabled the over 60s to socialise with their peers in a warm and comfortable environment. The over 60s suggested other  developments which would support them. i e Lists of local websites, a hands on demonstration of an ipad and its features for those considering an ipad purchase. Another suggestion which was implemented was the live demonstration of Hebridean Connections a local genealogy site. 

Advertising in Events worked well. 
Word of mouth worked well.
Laughter was often heard. 
Many Light bulb moments. 
Having the Retirement Centre as a venue was re-assuring to many. 
Those getting to grips with mobile phones would bring laptops or kindles on subsequent visits. 
Many friendships were renewed


### Lessons learned

There is a huge demand for this kind of support. Tea and Technology created an informal sociable environment which worked. There is a demand for this kind of group in other community centres in the rural area of Lewis
